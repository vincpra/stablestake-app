Set up => `yarn; yarn typechain`.

StableStake.sol is the only contract used. (TOKEN.sol has been used on BNB Chain Testnet only).

Scripts can be used as seen in package.json, for example "yarn deploy:bscMainnet" runs deploy.ts using BNB Chain Mainnet.

Read comments for each script in order to know what their purpose is.
